*Reinforcement Learning* is an area of Machine Learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
<br>

*Deep Q Learning*
: This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network to predict the actions.
<br>

- Game is implemented using *PyGame*.

- Model is implemented using *PyTorch*.
